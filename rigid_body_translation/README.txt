Reference image naming conventions.

In the DIC challenge images, Reu provides two, high-contrast reference images. The image labelled with a prefix _s denotes the second reference image from which all of the deformed images were created. The other reference image is a second still shot with a different noise set. 

When correlating the deformed images with the second reference image, the correlation software should be able to identify the imposed displacement exactly since they all encode the same noise floor. When correlated with the other image, the error should increase since there are now two sets of noise being correlated.
