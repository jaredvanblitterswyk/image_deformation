Qi's speckle pattern from uniaxial tensile testing of GFRP composites (used for initial VFM identification demosntration).

Upsample factor: 4

Applied displacement: 0 pixels at top edge, deform bottom by 1 pixel each image and linearly fit the displacements across the field.

Total deformation: 5 pixels, 5 steps
